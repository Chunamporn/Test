Project Description
This project aims to predict a company's Return on Equity (ROE) for the next year using machine learning, based on financial ratios derived from the DuPont Analysis framework. The model uses three key features — Profit Margin Ratio (PMR), Asset Turnover Ratio (ATR), and Equity Multiplier (EQM) — to forecast ROE.

The app was built using:
Real-world financial data pulled via Yahoo Finance
A trained XGBoost regression model, improved through feature scaling and winsorization
A fully interactive Streamlit web interface that:
 1)Predicts ROE from live ticker data
 2)Compares predictions to actual ROE
 3)Allows custom input simulation
 4)Provides visualizations and error diagnostics
